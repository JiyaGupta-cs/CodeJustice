To achieve this, you can create a system that fetches information about a video when an influencer pastes the link. You can use libraries like BeautifulSoup for web scraping and APIs provided by platforms like YouTube for video information retrieval. Here's a simplified example using Python:



This script fetches information about a YouTube video by scraping the HTML content of the video's link. However, keep in mind that web scraping might violate a platform's terms of service. It's recommended to use official APIs provided by platforms like YouTube to access video metadata.

For YouTube, you can use the YouTube Data API to fetch video information such as view count and channel subscriber count. The code above provides a basic example using web scraping, but in a real-world scenario, you should use the official API for accurate and authorized access to video data.
