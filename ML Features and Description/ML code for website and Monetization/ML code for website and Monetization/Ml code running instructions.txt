This code creates a simple Flask app with a single /predict endpoint that accepts POST requests with JSON data. You'd replace make_prediction() with your actual machine learning model code.

To use this code:

Save it in a file, for example, app.py.
Run the app by executing python app.py in your terminal.
Your Flask app will start and run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
You can then send POST requests to http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict with JSON data to get predictions back. For example, you could use tools like requests in Python or use frontend technologies like JavaScript's fetch() to send data from a website to this endpoint and receive predictions back.

Remember, this is a basic structure. You'll need to integrate your actual machine learning model and handle data appropriately based on your model's requirements and the structure of your website. Additionally, ensure proper error handling and security measures when deploying this in a production environment.
